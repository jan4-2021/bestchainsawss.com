<p><strong>PureFireÂ two-stroke engine: </strong>The 32.2Â cc 1.6 hp PureFire of the Tanaka TCS33EDTP/14 is shown to provide clean cuts across tree branches and trunks. The emission levels are equally met with less fuel consumption therefore making you an environmentally friendly user of this state of the art chainsaw. It also has a pre-built lanyard ring which allows the chainsaw easy climbing without any added fatigue since it is lightweight.</p>
<p><strong>14&#8243; Oregon sprocket nose bar and chain: </strong>The makers of the Tanaka TCS33EDTP/14 have added a state of the art Oregon sprocket nose bar which allows for added control when maneuvering the chainsaw hence leading to clean cuts. The user also has an added advantage of adjusting the chain with the help of a side access chain tensioner.</p>
